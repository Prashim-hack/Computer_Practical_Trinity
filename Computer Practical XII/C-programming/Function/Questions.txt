1. WAP to find sum of two numbers using function named sum().
2. WAP to know a number is even or odd usingfunction named evenodd().
3. WAP to print the greatest value among threenumbers using a function int great().We have to use return statement.
4. WAP to know a number is prime or composite usingfunction.
5. WAP to find sum of series 1,2,3,…..200 usingfunction. Assume yourself function name. It returns aninteger value.
6. WAP to input elements of an array and print themwith their sum. Suppose, the array is one dimensional and is of void type andfunction to be used is array_elements().
7. Suppose a function void matrix_sum(int a[][],intb[][]).Here, we have passed array as parameter. Use this function to find sumof matrices.
8. WAP to sort ‘n’ number of strings usingfunction. Pass strings as parameter.
9. WAP to find factorial value of a number usingrecursive function.
